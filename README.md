#### Overview

This is a Library Management System project that includes various modules such as Maintenance, Reports, and Transactions.

#### Key Features

- **Maintenance**: The maintenance module is used for creating and updating reports and transactions.

- **Basic Formatting**: The application includes basic screen formatting for a user-friendly interface.

- **Navigation**: You'll find a "Chart" link on all pages to help users navigate through the application.

- **Input Validation**: Form validation ensures that users provide the necessary information.

- **Admin and User Access**: Admin users have access to Maintenance, Reports, and Transactions, while regular users have access to Reports and Transactions.

- **Book Availability**: In the Book Availability module, users must select at least one option (text box or drop-down) before submitting the form.

- **Search Results**: Users can search for available books and select books to issue using radio buttons.

- **Book Issue**: When issuing a book, the system validates the name of the book and author, and it checks that the issue date is not earlier than the current date. The return date is automatically set to 15 days from the issue date.

- **Return Book**: When returning a book, users must provide the book's serial number. The return date is automatically populated and can be edited. Fine payment is allowed only if a pending fine is present.

- **Fine Payment**: The system calculates fines and allows users to pay them. The remarks field is non-mandatory.

- **Add Membership**: Users can add memberships for 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years.

- **Update Membership**: Memberships can be extended or canceled.

- **Add Book**: Users can add books, specifying whether they are books or movies. All fields are mandatory.

- **Update Book**: Similar to adding books, but allows for updates.

- **User Management**: New user creation and existing user management.
